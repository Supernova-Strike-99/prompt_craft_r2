# Project for the promptcraft FINAL Round 

->About This Project:
Every day, people misplace or come across items like wallets, keys, books, and umbrellas. The primary challenge is not finding the item, but connecting the person who lost it with the one who found it.


This project is a web-based platform designed to solve this problem. The goal is to create a simple yet effective system where users can log in, report lost or found items, and browse existing posts to help reunite people with their belongings.


->Core Features:
This platform implements the following core functionalities:


->User Accounts: Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profile.


->Post Items: Logged-in users can report a lost or found item by filling out a form. The form captures:


-Item Name

-Description

-Location

-Date

-Contact Info


->Browse & Search: A public page where users can view all posted lost and found items.


->Access Control: To protect user privacy, only users who are logged in can post new items or view the contact details on existing posts.

->Design Guidance
The user interface (UI) is designed to be clean, modern, and mobile-friendly.

->Creative Freedom
Beyond the basic requirements listed above, the project specifications encourage adding extra features or creative twists.
